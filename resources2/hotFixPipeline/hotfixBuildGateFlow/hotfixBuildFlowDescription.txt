This phase starts the ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateFlow which will perform a checkout CI-Production_Hotfixes branch and Pre-Merging Release_Hotfixes locally to ensure fast-forward compatibility. If that is successful the following two jobs will be kicked off in parallel:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>B-1. ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateBuild</strong> - This job facilitates the checkout the CI-Production_Hotfixes branch, building + compilation of the code, upload of the build artifacts to nexus and the downstream trigger of the <strong>ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGate-Tests</strong></p>

    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B-1a. ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateTests </strong>- This job facilities the deployment of your build artifacts from your execution of the ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateBuild to a chosen FT environment and then the execution of the CI-Production_Hotfixes's version of the Gated SmokeTests
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>B-2. ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateBuild-testSonarInt </strong>- This job facilitates the checkout of the CI-Production_Hotfixes branch, building + compilation of the code, the execution of all unit and integration tests, and the preview analysis of the sonar-runner
<p>
<strong>If successful the ELIS2-HOTFIX-BuildGateFlow will formally promote your hash to the Release_Hotfixes branch. This action will trigger the ELIS2-IntegrationGateFlow</strong>
